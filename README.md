## Nested Dictionary
* Is a collection of keys values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.
* A dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly braces, separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds pairs of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
